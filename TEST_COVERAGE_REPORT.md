## Service Coverage Breakdown

### Perfect Coverage (100%)
- `child_service.py`: 100% (49 lines)
- `config_service.py`: 100% (61 lines)
- `employee_service.py`: 100% (49 lines)
- `import_service.py`: 100% (89 lines)

### Excellent Coverage (>95%)
- `export_service.py`: 98.84% (86 lines, 1 missed)
- `shift_service.py`: 97.67% (172 lines, 4 missed)

### Good Coverage (>80%)
- `forecast_service.py`: 91.94% (124 lines, 10 missed)
- `payroll_service.py`: 89.63% (135 lines, 14 missed)
- `pdf_budget_parser.py`: 82.61% (138 lines, 24 missed)

### Needs Improvement
- `budget_service.py`: 78.79% (132 lines, 28 missed)

## Route Coverage
Routes have lower coverage (12-62%) as they primarily test API endpoints through integration tests.

## Test Suite Organization

### Unit Tests (services/)
- `test_child_service.py`: Complete CRUD and validation tests
- `test_employee_service.py`: Employee management tests
- `test_shift_service.py`: Shift creation, validation, conflict detection
- `test_payroll_service.py`: Period management, exclusions, summaries
- `test_import_service.py`: CSV import and shift replacement logic
- `test_export_service.py`: CSV, JSON, and PDF export tests
- `test_config_service.py`: Hour limits and settings management
- `test_budget_service.py`: Budget CRUD, allocations, utilization
- `test_forecast_service.py`: Available hours, patterns, projections
- `test_pdf_budget_parser.py`: PDF parsing and data extraction

### Integration Tests
- `test_routes.py`: API endpoint testing for all routes
- Fixture improvements for proper test isolation

## Key Improvements Made
1. Fixed foreign key constraint issues in test fixtures
2. Corrected method signatures to match actual implementations
3. Added comprehensive mocking for database operations
4. Implemented proper test data fixtures
5. Created integration tests for all major workflows

## Remaining Issues (29 failures)
- Some PDF generation tests failing due to reportlab dependencies
- Integration tests need additional fixture setup
- Bulk exclusion creation tests need date handling fixes

## Recommendations
1. Focus on increasing route coverage through more integration tests
2. Add E2E tests for critical user workflows
3. Fix remaining test failures to achieve 100% pass rate
4. Consider adding performance benchmarks for database operations
