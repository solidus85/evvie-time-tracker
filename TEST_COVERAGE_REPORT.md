### Database Tests
- `test_database_integrity.py`: 23 tests for database constraints, migrations, and transactions

## Key Improvements Made
1. Fixed foreign key constraint issues in test fixtures
2. Corrected method signatures to match actual implementations
3. Added comprehensive mocking for database operations
4. Implemented proper test data fixtures
5. Created integration tests for all major workflows

## Remaining Issues (6 failures)
- 2 Bulk exclusion tests: Date range calculation issues in mocked payroll periods
- 1 E2E payroll test: CSV import format expectations
- 1 Shift status test: Status filtering not implemented
- 1 Budget utilization test: Response key expectations
- 1 Performance test: Flaky timing (disabled in CI)

## Achievements
✅ **Coverage Goal Exceeded**: Achieved 78.57% (target was 77.47%)
✅ **Test Count Increased**: 424+ tests (up from 312)
✅ **Pass Rate Improved**: 98.6% (up from 90.7%)
✅ **Database Integrity**: Added comprehensive constraint testing
✅ **Import Coverage**: Improved from 36% to ~60%

## Future Recommendations
1. Increase forecast and budget route coverage to 80%+
2. Add performance benchmarks for large datasets
3. Fix remaining 6 test failures for 100% pass rate
4. Consider adding security penetration tests
5. Add load testing for concurrent operations
